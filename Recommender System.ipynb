    "# Designing a Basic Recommender System using TMDB Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the design and implementation of a basic recommender system using the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset. Recommender systems are widely used in various domains to suggest items to users based on their preferences and behavior. There are several types of recommender systems, including Demographic Filtering, Collaborative Filtering, and Content-Based Filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Demographic Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic filtering recommends items based on demographic information such as age, gender, occupation, etc., without considering the user's preferences or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering recommends items to users based on the preferences of other users. It can be user-based or item-based, where recommendations are made either by finding similar users or similar items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Content-Based Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Content-based filtering recommends items to users based on the features or characteristics of the items themselves. It analyzes the content of items and recommends similar items based on their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in Designing the Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Recommender System Based on Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will design a content-based recommender system that recommends movies based on their overview or summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Recommender System Based on Actors and Directors\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will enhance the content-based recommender system by incorporating information about actors and directors. This will allow us to recommend movies based on the involvement of specific actors or directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Recommender System Based on Actors, Directors, and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Building upon the previous step, we will create a more comprehensive recommender system that considers both the overview of the movies and the involvement of actors and directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Recommender System Based on Actors, Directors, Overview, and Genres\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will further refine our recommender system by including information about movie genres. This will enable us to recommend movies based on a combination of actors, directors, overview, and genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have demonstrated the design and implementation of a basic recommender system using content-based filtering techniques. By leveraging information about movies such as overview, actors, directors, and genres, we can provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences.\n"

    "     - Convert text to lowercase.\n",
    "     - Remove punctuation.\n",
    "     - Tokenize the text.\n",

    "3. **TF-IDF Vectorization:**\n",
    "   - Apply `preprocess_text()` to each document, resulting in a list of preprocessed documents.\n",

    "   - Fit the vectorizer to the preprocessed data and transform documents into a TF-IDF feature matrix.\n",

    "### WordNetLemmatizer\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Word lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma), ensuring that different inflected forms of a word are treated as the same word.\n",
    "- **Example**: Lemmatization converts words like \"running\" and \"ran\" to their base form \"run\".\n",
    "- **Importance**: It helps in standardizing the vocabulary, improving the effectiveness of downstream tasks such as vectorization and similarity calculation.\n",
    "- **Application**: In this code, `WordNetLemmatizer` from NLTK is used to lemmatize tokens extracted from movie overviews, ensuring consistency in word representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### English Stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Stopwords are common words (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"and\") that are often removed during text preprocessing because they carry little meaning or significance.\n",
    "- **Example**: In the phrase \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", stopwords like \"the\", \"over\", and \"the\" contribute little to the meaning.\n",
    "- **Importance**: Removing stopwords reduces noise and dimensionality in the data, focusing on content-carrying words.\n",
    "- **Application**: In this code, a combination of NLTK's stopwords list and scikit-learn's built-in English stopwords (`ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS`) is used to filter out common stopwords during text preprocessing, enhancing the quality of the TF-IDF features and improving the accuracy of the recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "After preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization is performed using `TfidfVectorizer` from scikit-learn. TF-IDF reflects the importance of words in documents relative to a collection of documents. Here's how TF-IDF vectorization works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures the frequency of a term (word) within a document. Words that appear more frequently are assigned higher weights.\n",
    "- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Measures the rarity of a term across documents. Rare terms are assigned higher weights to emphasize their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is calculated as the product of TF and IDF. The resulting TF-IDF matrix represents each document as a vector in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a unique term."
